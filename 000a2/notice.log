Aug 18 18:11:24.000 [notice] Your OpenSSL version seems to be 0.9.8o. We recommend 1.0.0 or later.

Aug 18 18:11:25.000 [notice] We weren't able to find support for all of the TLS ciphersuites that we wanted to advertise. This won't hurt security, but it might make your Tor (if run as a client) more easy for censors to block.
Aug 18 18:11:25.000 [notice] To correct this, use a more recent OpenSSL, built without disabling any secure ciphers or features.
